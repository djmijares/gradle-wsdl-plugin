gradle-wsdl-plugin
==================

plugin for gradle that sets up a wsdl task and sets up a convention between the sub project web service name and the wsdl document itself

# Project Name to Wsdl Name Conventions #

It is assumed that for a web-service, your project name will be of the form 

*some-particular-service-ws* where the *-ws* is **REQUIRED**

Here are some possible mappings of project name to wsdl service Straight from the tests

>  "spock-star-trek-ws"   >> "SpockStarTrekService" 

>  "srv-legend-ws"        >> "SrvLegendService" 
   
>  "boy-band-ws"          >> "BoyBandService" 

it takes the project name from a hyphenated value to camel case and replaces the  **-ws** with **Service**

# wsdl plugin conventions #
```groovy
wsdlDirectory -- File object to the wsdl Directory
wsdlFileName -- The wsdl Name found at the wsdl Directory
wsdlPath -- File object of the absolute path to the wsdl File
episodeDirectory  -- File object to the default episode File directory
```

*ASSUMING* you are generating schemas with the jaxb task (found in another plugin I developed [here](https://github.com/djmijares/gradle-jaxb-namespace-dependency) that you can use.  There is also another one found [here](https://github.com/stianh/gradle-jaxb-plugin)

## jaxws wsimport conventions ##

The plugin uses an ant jaxws wsimport task to parse the wsdl into java code, and the plugin is default configured with these variables and boolean values
```groovy
String sourceDestinationDirectory
boolean verbose = true
boolean keep = true
boolean xnocompile = true
boolean fork = false
boolean xdebug = false
String target = "2.1"
String wsdlLocation = "FILL_IN_BY_SERVER"
```
the **target** is defaulted to **2.1** because in my experience, not many people have updated to Java 7 yet, and I think it is easier to use something like 
```groovy
wsdl {
  target = "2.2"
}
```

**IF** you happen to be using java 7.  

configuration **sourceDestinationDirectory** is defaulted to **src/main/java** where your generated classes will normally go.  Some have different philosophies on if you should save your generated files to your repository.  I have always said that you should, so that if nothing has changed in your schema/wsdl documents, you don't have to run the tasks to parse those documents -- and that if something has changed, it will be reflected in your VC diff.

If you care to not keep your generated files, set *keep* to *false*.  See the available jaxws wsimport ant task options [here](http://jax-ws.java.net/2.2.3/docs/wsimportant.html)

## Binding to previously generated schema documents with jaxb episode binding ##
you can use the configuration 
    List episodes
to configure the wsimport task to bind with episode files at the **episodeDirectory** like so:
```groovy
wsdl {
  episodes = ["name-of-episode-file-sans-episode-extension"]
}
```
This will go and find the file **name-of-episode-file-sans-episode-extension.episode** at **episodeDirectory** even though you didn't include the episode file extension in the property configuration

# Examples #
You can find some examples in the *examples* directory

# List of available tasks #
* `parseWsdl`
	- run wsimport ant task on the WSDL file name (determined from task `wsdlName`)
* `war`
	- automatically generates the war like a regular WAR would, but also auto populates the war with the default `wsdl` directory containing the wsdl the project uses and will auto populate with the correct `schema` directory and all imported schemas.  

The war would look like this (see the *hello-world-episode-binding-ws* example)
