- A lot of major parts re-written to make them cleaner, and easier to understand.
- `ParseWsdl` renamed to `WsImport` task.

### New Features

#### Name Rules
- Name Rules feature is added to turn abbreviations in the project name and
  substitute their meaning to find the appropriate WSDL name.  See the
  [readme](README.md)

#### Nested Extensions Extensions broken up into `WsdlPluginExtension` and
`WsImportExtension` to separate the wsimport defaults from cluttering up.  The
[readme](README.md) shows how to configure.

### Tasks
- The plugin now has 5 distinct tasks to
  - Parse WSDL
    - task name: `parseWsdl`
    - using wsimport Ant Task
  - Get WSDL Name
    - from the convention previously established project-name -> wsdl name
    - task name: `wsdlName`
  - Resolve WSDL dependencies
    - find all file's required for WSDL project in WAR,
    - task name : `resolveWSDLDependencies`
  - Group WSDL Files for WAR
    - Groups all the wsdl dependent files by the same parent directory and keeps
      track of the files in this directory that need to be included in the WAR
      file
    - task name: `groupWsdlWarFiles`
  - Copy WSDL Files
    - Copies all the grouped WSDL Files to the output directory
      `webServiceCopyDir`
    - task name: `copyWsdlWarFiles`

#### Overridden Task
- Gradle WAR task is overriden with added functionality to include the files in
  the output directory of the `copyWsdlWarFiles` task
  - see the `webServiceCopyDir` extension property

### Deployed to bintray Bintray deploy used to be an ivy repository, now is
deploying to a maven repository.

- url : `http://dl.bintray.com/content/djmijares/gradle-plugins/`
- group: `com.jacobo.gradle`
- package : `gradle-wsdl-plugin`
- version : `1.5`


### new script plugins The build script was broken up into

- `integTest.gradle`
- `cobertura.gradle`
- `buildscript.gradle`

for readability

#### Cobertura Cobertura is added to this project for test coverage

### Complete Refactor Alot of the code was refactored, I thought some of the
methods did too much, and I broke them up and wrote test for them.

### Documentation `docs` folder is holding all extra documentation for specific
configuration and extra comments that are not pertinent to immediately getting
set up with the default configuration.

### Testing

#### Integration Testing
- source set `integTest` in `src/main` has one integration test for this
  project.  Some of the unit tests might be moved here sometimes in the future,
  as they aren't true unit tests.

### New Files
- `CopyWsdlWarFilesTask` and Spec `CopyWsdlWarFilesTaskSpec`
- `WsImportExtension`
- `WsdlSlurper` and Spec `WsdlSlurperSpec`
- `XsdSlurper` and Spec `XsdSlurperSpec`
- `DocumentReader` and Spec `DocumentReaderSpec`

- `WsdlWarFileGrouper` and Spec `WsdlWarFileGrouperSpec`
