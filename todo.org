* List of todo's as I've gone through
  
  These are not in any particular order.

*  TODO investigate the WsdlNameTask 
   as to why the Name Task which populates the wsdlPath in the Extension class 
   but doesn't register for the InputFile of the Parse Task (ParseWsdlTask)


* TODO Correct the Task level application in the apply method
  
  - Move all task definition in the apply method and the plugin class to move to the higher level Task interface 
  - lose the lower level WsdlNameTask class name

* TODO Remove the wsdl resolver task
  - because the war is being fussy
  - figure out how to make the war play 
  - post some questions on the forums about this

* DONE add a more complicated example of a wsdl importing a schema 
  - from the schema folder and check that the output of the war is correct

* DONE add a wsdl that import an schema file but uses episode binding 
  - avoids regeneration
  CLOSED: [2013-01-19 Sat 21:03]
  - create a schema project
  - use the jaxb plugin I wrote
  - create an episode directory in the schema folder
* TODO last example is a wsdl that imports schema that imports schema
  - to make sure the war is correct
* TODO what happens when an import doesn't have a schema Location?
  - it looks like it is failing, because the code doesn't handle an empty location
* TODO Investigate why multiple wsdls going into war
  - It looks like the episode binding example is putting all of the wsdl's in the wsdl folder in the WAR
