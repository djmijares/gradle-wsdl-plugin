* investigate as to why the Name Task which populates the wsdlPath in the Extension class doesn't register for the InputFile of the Parse Task

* Move all task definition in the apply method and the plugin class to move to the higher level Task interface and lose the lower level WsdlNameTask class name

* Remove the wsdl resolver task, because the war is being fussy, or figure out how to make the war play nice

* post some questions on the forums about these issues

* add a more complicated example of a wsdl importing a schema in the schema folder and check that the output of the war is correct
