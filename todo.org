* TODO investigate as to why the Name Task which populates the wsdlPath in the Extension class doesn't register for the InputFile of the Parse Task

* TODO Move all task definition in the apply method and the plugin class to move to the higher level Task interface and lose the lower level WsdlNameTask class name

* Remove the wsdl resolver task, because the war is being fussy, or figure out how to make the war play nice 
** TODO post some questions on the forums about these issues
* DONE add a more complicated example of a wsdl importing a schema in the schema folder and check that the output of the war is correct

* DONE add a wsdl that import an schema file but uses episode binding to avoid regeneration
  CLOSED: [2013-01-19 Sat 21:03]
** create a schema project
** use the jaxb plugin I wrote
** create an episode directory in the schema folder
* TODO last example is a wsdl that imports schema that imports schema, to make sure the war is correct
* TODO what happens when an import doesn't have a schema Location?
* It looks like the episode binding example is putting all of the wsdl's in the wsdl folder in the WAR, need to fix
